<h1> The Pixar Theory </h1>
<p1> The Pixar Theory, in short, is the theory that all of the Pixar movies take place along the 
same timeline, and more inportantly, the same universe(Pixar universe). I should start this 
website off with the fact that on more than one occation this 
theory has been denied by producers and higher ups in Pixar. That being said, it is something
that I enjoy thinking about and think is a cool enough throught to use for this project. For 
this project I will not be going into great detail on the theory, most of my time will be allocated
to learning the intricaices of web design</p1>
<h2>First up: The Good Dinosaur</h2>
<p2>The good dinosaur takes place in the age of the dinosaurs... Not much to explain here on why this 
is the first movie in the timeline. That being said, there is an importnat concept to address 
which is that in this universe, the dinosaurs were able to live much longer because
there was no global extinction, shown by the presence of early humans and mammals in this movie. 
This allowed them to develope languages and other further intelligence. Since there was 
no mass extinction in this unviverse, there is room for lots of other 
species to exist such as the anglerfish in Finding Nemo and the animals in paradise falls in
Up. Accprding to this theory, magic is a side effect of the extra evolution and is incorperated
into other films as well which will be touched upon later.</p2>
<h3>Brave: which takes place in the 10th century</h3>
<p3>This movie shows us the existence of magic with objects and animals that behave like humans.
There is also a fun bit in this theory that the whitch which is avtually Boo from Monsters Inc.
I will explain the more when we get to that movie.</p3>
<h4>Both Increadibles: Takes place in the 1950s and 1960s</h4>
<p4>The superpowers and the zero point energy are both a result of the magic that was introduced
in Brave. Toys will absorb the zero point energy which leads to the Toy Story movies. There is a 
little bit of evidence of the machines rising against humans in this movie when the Omnidroid v. 10
stops listening to its creator. Here we see a restaurant that, Luxo's Deli, that expands into other businesses seen in other movies. In the second increadibles, Evelyn Deavor who is the villain, 
speaks of humans being too obsessed with technology and ease of life. This is considered evidence 
of how things end up the way that they do in the movie WALL-E.</p4>
