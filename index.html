<h1 class="header"> The Pixar Theory </h1>
<p "id=p1"> The Pixar Theory, in short, is the theory that all of the Pixar movies take place 
along the 
same timeline, and more inportantly, the same universe(Pixar universe). I should start this 
website off with the fact that on more than one occation this 
theory has been denied by producers and higher ups in Pixar. That being said, it is something
that I enjoy thinking about and think is a cool enough thought to use for this project. For 
this project I will not be going into great detail on the theory, most of my time will be allocated
to learning the intricaices of web design</p>

<p "id=p16">In the link under this paragraph you will be taken to the page that has the timeline
of the theory. Please feel free to press on what you can and check out all that page has to offer.</p>

<a href="index2.html">The Timeline</a>

<p "id=p17">If you are coming back from the timeline I hope you enjoyed the brief overview of the 
theory. If you are not coming from the timeline page... go there and try this message again.</p>
